Those gilded flies

That, basking in the sunshine of a court,

Fatten on its corruption! what are they?—

The drones of the community; they feed

On the mechanic’s labour …

Whence, thinkest thou, kings and parasites arose?

Whence that unnatural line of drones who heap

Toil and unvanquishable penury

On those who build their palaces and bring

Their daily bread?—From vice, black loathsome vice;

From rapine, madness, treachery, and wrong;

From all that genders misery, and makes

Of earth this thorny wilderness; from lust,

Revenge, and murder …

But the queen also expresses hope for the possibility of a better world:

But hoary-headed selfishness has felt

Its death-blow and is tottering to the grave;

A brighter morn awaits the human day,

When every transfer of earth’s natural gifts

Shall be a commerce of good words and works;

When poverty and wealth, the thirst of fame,

The fear of infamy, disease and woe,

War with its million horrors, and fierce hell,

Shall live but in the memory of time …
